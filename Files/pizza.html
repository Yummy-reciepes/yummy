      <h4>Making doughs</h4>
      <li><p>First, in a large bowl mix together 1.5 teaspoons instant yeast and Â½ teaspoon of sugar.</p></li>
      <li><p>Add 1 cup of lukewarm water (44 degrees Celsius) and stir. Set aside and let the yeast activate.</p></li>
       <li><p>You should start to see the yeast mixture bubbling up and doubling in size after about 10 to 15 minutes.</p></li>
      <li><p>Combine 1 cup of unbleached all purpose flour (or bread flour) with 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 tablespoons of olive oil.</p></li>
      <li><p>Stir with a whisk or wooden spoon or steel spoon.</p></li>
      <li><p>Add one more cup of the flour.</p></li>
      <li><p>Keep on stirring. The mixture will be quite sticky.</p></li>
      <li><p> Add the last cup of flour and continue to stir. The dough will start to form and leave the sides of the bowl, but will still be sticky.</p></li>
      <li><p>Now itâs time to knead the dough by hand until it forms a smooth dough. Dust with flour to prevent sticking as you work. The dough will be soft and elastic, and no longer sticky.</p></li>
      <li><p>Keep your dough in the deep bowl, and lightly apply a bit of olive oil all around the outside of the dough. This will keep it from sticking to the sides of the bowl once the dough proves and grows.</p></li>
      <li><p>After exactly 1 hour my dough had risen and doubled up to what you see below.</p></li>
      <li><p>If you plan to make the pizza the next day, then wrap the dough tightly in a plastic wrap and keep in the fridge.</p></li>
       <li><p>To make the pizza right away, portion and flatten the dough to a disk. In the below photo, you can see that the dough has leavened well, with stringy strands and many air pockets that will make a chewy crust.</p></li>
      <h4>Making Pizza Sauce from scratch</h4>
      <li><p>You can choose to either chop the tomatoes (500 grams or 5 to 6 medium tomatoes) and use them fresh to make the sauce, or blanch them first and then add in a blender.
        Blanching will reduce the cooking time, but is not necessary for making a delicious sauce.</p></li>
      <li><p>Crush the raw or blanched tomatoes in the blender to make a puree that is as smooth or chunky as you like for this pizza recipe.</p></li>
      <li><p>Next, in a large sauce pan heat Â¼ cup olive oil, and add 2 teaspoons minced garlic. SautÃ© and stir for some seconds to soften the garlic.
      Now add the tomato puree, and mix well.</p></li>
       <li><p>Continue stirring and let the tomatoes cook for 5 minutes.</p></li>
       <li><p>Add salt as needed. Mix and stir.</p></li>
      <li><p>Cover the pan with lid and simmer the tomato sauce on low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes have softened.
        If the sauce looks too thick you can add Â¼ cup water. Then cover and continue to cook.</p></li>
      <li><p>Simmer until the tomatoes have completely cooked and the sauce has thickened.</p></li>
      <li><p>Stir in herbs and crushed black pepper.</p></li>
      <li><p>Mix the sauce well and set aside.</p></li>
      <h4>Assembling and baking</h4>
      <li><p>First, preheat the oven to the highest temperature in your oven.
        In my oven it is 230 degrees Celsius (450 degrees Fahrenheit).
        Grease a round metal baking pan with olive oil, and then lightly dust it with maize flour (cornmeal), semolina (rava or sooji) or flour.</p></li>
       <li><p>Divide the pizza dough into equals parts to make either 4 small or 2 large or 3 medium size pizzas.
         Wrap any dough youâre not using in plastic wrap and keep in the fridge for up to 3 days total.</p></li>
       <li><p>Using clean, dry hands, take one portion of the divided dough and roll it into a neat round ball.
         Place on a cutting board or countertop thatâs been lightly coated with some flour, and sprinkle the dough with a light dusting of more flour.</p></li>
       <li><p>Use a rolling pin to roll the dough ball into a large round or oval shape of about â to Â¼ inch thickness.
         Roll the dough from the center towards the outer edges for the most even pizza dough. You may have to dust the surface with flour as you work.</p></li>
      <li><p>Once stretched to the desired size, gently place the pizza base in the greased baking pan. Be careful not to tear the dough, as it is very soft and stretchy.</p></li>
       <li><p>At this point you can prick the dough with a fork if you want a thinner, crisper crust. This also helps in the crust not puffing up when baking.
         However, you can leave the dough as-is for a fluffier, chewier veg pizza crust.</p></li>
      <li><p>Use a pastry brush to lightly brush the surface of the crust with olive oil.</p></li>
      <li><p>Then, spread the tomato sauce on the pizza in a thin, even layer. Leave about an inch of dough around the outer edge free from sauce for a perfect pizza crust.</p></li>
      <li><p>Top the sauce with a generous handful or two of shredded mozzarella cheese.</p></li>
       <li><p>Place your choice of veggies on top of the cheese, making sure to spread the toppings evenly.</p></li>
      <li><p> Next, add a light layer of grated parmesan cheese to finish the pizza.</p></li>
      <li><p> Place the baking pan close to the lower heating element (or you can keep it even on the crumb tray of your OTG) to get the crispiest crust and perfectly molten, gooey melted cheese.
        Bake the veg pizza in the preheated oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the cheese melts and the crust is golden.</p></li>
      <li><p>Your perfect personalized veg pizza is now ready to enjoy!</p></li>
